Analytics extensions built with `plumbertableau` are designed to be easily used from within Tableau Workbook calculated fields. When extensions are published to RStudio Connect, a Tableau usage guide is automatically generated. When viewing an extension on RStudio Connect, users will see a page like the following:

![Tableau usage guide](files/tableau-usage-guide.png){width=75%}

This page details exactly what is necessary to use the extension from within Tableau.

In order to ensure values are correctly passed from Tableau to the extension, Tableau aggregation needs to be turned off.
