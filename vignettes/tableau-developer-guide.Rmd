Analytics extensions built with `plumbertableau` are designed to be easily used from within calculated fields in  Tableau Workbooks. When extensions are published to RStudio Connect, a Tableau usage guide is automatically generated and displayed when viewing the extension on RStudio Connect:

This page includes the following details about the extension:
* A description of the endpoint
* Links to other important pieces of documentation. This includes a setup guide for Tableau and the OpenAPI (Swagger) documentation for the extension.
* An example of a `SCRIPT_` command to be used from within a calculated field in Tableau
* Descriptions of the different parameters, arguments, and return data

Using this reference page, you can copy and paste the `SCRIPT_` command into a calculated field in Tableau and replace the argument placeholders with actual values from the Tableau workbook.

In order to ensure values are correctly passed from Tableau to the extension, Tableau aggregation needs to be turned off.
