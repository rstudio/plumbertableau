plumbertableau lets you call external R code in real time from Tableau workbooks via [Tableau Analytics Extensions](https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/). You achieve this by writing a plumbertableau extension, which is a [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) API with some extra annotations â€” comments prefixed with `#*`.

```{r capitalize}
```

plumbertableau extensions are used in Tableau's *calculated fields*. Let's imagine we've published our extension to RStudio Connect and have given it the custom URL `stringutils`. To use our `capitalize` extension, we'd type the following into a Tableau calculated field, or just copy and paste it from the automatically generated code samples. (In real usage, you'll probably replace `"Hello World"` with references to Tableau data.)

```
SCRIPT_STR("/stringutils/capitalize", "Hello World")
```

Before you use the extension in Tableau, Tableau needs to be able to access it. plumbertableau integrates seamlessly with [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/), a commercial publishing platform that enables R developers to easily publish a variety of R content types. Connect lets you host multiple extensions by ensuring that requests from Tableau are passed to the correct extension. It's also possible to host plumbertableau extensions on your own servers.

## Installation
You can install plumbertableau from CRAN or install the latest development version from GitHub.

```r
# From CRAN
install.packages("plumbertableau")

# From GitHub
remotes::install_github("rstudio/plumbertableau")

library(plumbertableau)
```

## FAQ
#### I thought Tableau already supports R?
Tableau's current support for R as an analytics extension is built on
[`Rserve`](http://rforge.net/Rserve/index.html). This approach requires
configuring Rserve in a separate environment and then passing R code as plain
text from Tableau calculated fields to be executed by Rserve.

#### Why would I use this instead of RServe?
The approach suggested here allows specific endpoints to be called, rather than
requiring the Tableau user to write and submit R code in a plain text field from
Tableau. This allows Tableau users to be seperate from the extension developers.
R developers can build extensions that are then used by Tableau developers who
may have no working knowledge of R.

#### Is RStudio Connect required?
While this package has been designed specifically with RStudio Connect in mind,
it will work independent of RStudio Connect.

#### What are the advantages of RStudio Connect?
RStudio Connect offers a number of advantages as a deployment platform for
Tableau Analytics Extensions:

- Tableau workbooks can only be configured to use a single extension endpoint,
which typically limits a workbook to only using one type of extension. RStudio
Connect can host both R and Python based extensions, which means that a single
Tableau workbook can use both R and Python based extensions hosted on RStudio
Connect.
- R developers can develop extensions in their preferred development environment
and then publish to RStudio Connect
- Extensions published to RStudio Connect can be secured to only allow access
from specific accounts
- RStudio Connect natively handles
[R](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/r/package-management/) and
[Python](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/python/package-management/)
packages, which allows extensions to seemlessly use different versions of
underlying packages without creating conflicts.
- RStudio Connect processes are
[sandboxed](https://docs.rstudio.com/connect/admin/process-management/#sandboxing),
which limits the scope of impact the extension can have on the underlying OS.

#### Why can't I just write my own Plumber API to function as an analytics extension?
Tableau Analytics Extensions are configured to reach out to two specific endpoints:

  - `/info`: Information about the extension
  - `/evaluate`: Execution endpoint for the extension
  
plumbertableau automatically generates the `/info` endpoint and reroutes
requests to `/evaluate` to the endpoint defined in the `script` value of the
request body. This allows multiple endpoints to function as extensions, rather
than relying on a single extension operating under `/evaluate`. These features
are intended to allow the R developer to easily create Tableau Analytics
Extensions as standard Plumber APIs without needing to worry about the lower
level implementation.
