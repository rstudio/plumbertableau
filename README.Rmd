plumbertableau lets you call external R code from Tableau workbooks via [Tableau Analytics Extensions](https://tableau.github.io/analytics-extensions-api/). You achieve this by writing a plumbertableau extension, which is a [Plumber](https://www.rplumber.io/) API with some extra annotations â€” comments prefixed with `#*`.

```{r capitalize}
```

plumbertableau extensions are used in Tableau's *calculated fields*. Let's imagine we've published our extension to RStudio Connect and have given it the custom URL `stringutils`. To use our `capitalize` extension, we'd type the following into a Tableau calculated field, or just copy and paste it from the automatically generated code samples. (In real usage, you'll probably replace `"Hello World"` with references to Tableau data.)

```
SCRIPT_STR("/stringutils/capitalize", "Hello World")
```

Before you use the extension in Tableau, Tableau needs to be able to access it. plumbertableau integrates seamlessly with [RStudio Connect](https://www.rstudio.com/products/connect/), a commercial publishing platform that enables R developers to easily publish a variety of R content types. Connect lets you host multiple extensions by ensuring that requests from Tableau are passed to the correct extension. It's also possible to host plumbertableau extensions on your own servers.

## Installation
You can install plumbertableau from CRAN or install the latest development version from GitHub.

```r
# From CRAN
install.packages("plumbertableau")

# From GitHub
remotes::install_github("rstudio/plumbertableau")

library(plumbertableau)
```
